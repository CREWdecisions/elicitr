cont_sample_data(
  x,
  round,
  ...,
  var = "all",
  n_votes = 1000,
  weights = 1,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \link{elic_cont}.}

\item{round}{integer indicating if the data belongs to the first or second
elicitation round.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments, included only for future extensions of the
function.}

\item{var}{character string with the name of the variable or character vector
with more variable names that you want to extract from the data. Use \code{all}
for all variables.}

\item{n_votes}{numeric indicating the number of votes to consider.}

\item{weights}{numeric vector with the weights to apply to the estimates. If
equal to \code{1}, each experts get \code{n_votes} votes, see Weights below.}

\item{verbose}{logical, if TRUE it prints informative messages.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble}} with the sampled data. This object has
an additional class \code{cont_sample} used to implement the plotting method.

\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}

\code{cont_sample_data()} samples data based on expert estimates stored in the
\code{\link{elic_cont}} object.
}
\section{Weights}{

To provide a different number of votes to each expert, use the \code{weights}
argument. The length of the vector must be equal to the number of experts. If
provided when the elicitation type is the \emph{four points elicitation}, their
values overwrite the confidence estimates.
}

\section{Method}{

The function samples the data using the basic method. The basic method
samples the data based on the expert estimates with differences between the
different elicitation types:
\itemize{
\item \emph{one point elicitation}: the best estimate of each expert represent the
pool of values that are sampled \code{n_votes} \code{*} \code{n_experts} times, with
repetition.
\item \emph{three points elicitation}: the minimum, best, and maximum estimates of
each expert are used as scaling parameters of the PERT distribution from
which the data are sampled. The \code{weights} argument can be used to weight the
estimates of each expert.
\item \emph{five points elicitation}: the minimum, best, and maximum estimates of
each expert are rescaled according to their confidence and used as scaling
parameters of the PERT distribution from which the data are sampled.
