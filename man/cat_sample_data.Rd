\usage{
cat_sample_data(x, method, mechanism, ..., n_votes = 100, site = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \link{elic_cat}.}

\item{method}{character string with the name of the method to sample the
data. The available methods are: \emph{basic} and \emph{bootstrap}, see Methods below.}

\item{mechanism}{character string that indicates the machanism to which the
data belongs.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments, included only for future extensions of the
function.}

\item{n_votes}{numeric indicating the number of votes to consider, used only
in the \emph{basic} aggregation method.}

\item{site}{character string with the name of the site or character vector
with the sites that you want to extract from the data. Use \code{all} for all
sites.}
}
\value{
An \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble}} with the sampled data. This object has
the additional class \code{elic_cat_sample} used to implement the plotting method.
}
\description{
Sample data based on expert estimates stored in the \code{\link{elic_cat}} object.
}
\section{Methods}{

Two methods are implemented. These methods are explained in Vernet et al.
(2024), see references below.
\itemize{
\item \emph{basic}: This method samples data based on the expert estimates without
accounting for their confidence. Values are sampled from a Dirichlet
distribution using the expert estimates as parameters. When only one estimate
is provided, i.e. 100 \% for one level, the method assigns 100 \% to all votes
for this level.
\item \emph{bootstrap}: This method samples data based on the expert estimates
accounting for their confidence. The confidence is used to weight the
number of votes assigned to each expert. The method samples data from a
Dirichlet distribution using the expert estimates as parameters. When only
one estimate is provided, i.e. 100 \% for one level, the method assigns 100 \%
to all votes for this level.
