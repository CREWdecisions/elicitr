\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \link{elic_cat}.}

\item{data_source}{either a \code{\link[base:data.frame]{data.frame}} or
\code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble}}, a string with the path to a \emph{csv} or \emph{xlsx} file,
or anything accepted by the \link[googlesheets4:range_read]{read_sheet} function.}

\item{mechanism}{character string indicating what mechanism the data belongs to.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments, included only for future extensions of the
function.}

\item{sep}{character used as field separator, used only when \code{data_source} is
a path to a \emph{csv} file.}

\item{sheet}{integer or character to select the sheet. The sheet can be
referenced by its position with a number or by its name with a string. Used
only when \code{data_source} is a path to a \emph{xlsx} file or when data are imported
from \emph{Google Sheets}.}

\item{overwrite}{logical, whether to overwrite existing data already added to
the \link{elic_cont} object.}

\item{verbose}{logical, if \code{TRUE} prints informative messages.}
}
\value{
The provided object of class \link{elic_cat} updated with the data.

\code{elic_cat_add_data()} adds data to an \link{elic_cat} object from different
sources.
}
\section{Data format}{


For each mechanism, data are expected to have five columns, built as follows:
\itemize{
\item The first column of the data should hold the names of the experts. The name
of each expert should be repeated as many times as there are impact levels
and sites considered in the elicitation
(i.e. each expert should appear \eqn{number\ of\ levels
\cdot number\ of\ sites} times).
\item The second column should be the names of the levels of impact considered in
the elicitation. Each block of levels of impact should be repeated as many
times as there are sites considered.
\item The third column should hold the names of the sites considered in the
study. The name of each site should be repeated as many times as there are
levels of impact considered.
\item The fourth column should be the experts confidence in their own estimates
(given in percent). Experts should estimate how confident they are in their
estimates for each block of level of impact and for each site. Therefore,
expert confidence estimates should be repeated as many times as there are
levels of impact considered.
\item The final column should be the estimates of each expert for each site and
confidence level.
}
}

\section{Data cleaning}{


When data are added to the \link{elic_cat} object, first names are standardised
by converting capital letters to lower case, and by removing any whitespaces
and punctuation. Then, data are anonymised by converting names to short sha1
hashes. In this way, sensible information collected during the elicitation
process never reaches the \link{elic_cat} object.
