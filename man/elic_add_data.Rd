\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{elicit}.}

\item{data_source}{either a \code{\link[base:data.frame]{data.frame}} or
\code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble}}, a string with the path to a \emph{csv} or \emph{xlsx} file,
or anything accepted by the \link[googlesheets4:range_read]{read_sheet()}
function.}

\item{round}{integer indicating if the data belongs to the first or second
elicitation round.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments, included only for future extensions of the
function.}

\item{sep}{character used as field separator, used only when \code{data_source} is
a path to a \emph{csv} file.}

\item{sheet}{integer or character to select the sheet. The sheet can be
referenced by its position with a number or by its name with a string. Used
only when \code{data_source} is a path to a \emph{xlsx} file or when data are imported
from \emph{Google Sheets}.}

\item{overwrite}{logical, whether to overwrite existing data already added to
the \code{elicit} object.}

\item{verbose}{logical, if \code{TRUE} prints informative messages.}
}
\value{
The provided object of class \code{elicit} updated with the data.

\section{Data Format}{


Data are expected to have the name of the expert always as first column. The
only exception if for data coming from \emph{Google Sheet} which can have an
additional column with a timestamp. This column is automatically removed
before the data are added to the \code{elicit} object (see "Data cleaning"). After
the name it is expected one or more blocks which follow the specifications
below:

\emph{One point elicitation}:
\itemize{
\item \code{var_best}: best estimate for the variable
}

\emph{Three points elicitation}:
\itemize{
\item \code{var_min}: minimum estimate for the variable
\item \code{var_max}: maximum estimate for the variable
\item \code{var_best}: best estimate for the variable
}

\emph{Four points elicitation}:
\itemize{
\item \code{var_min}: minimum estimate for the variable
\item \code{var_max}: maximum estimate for the variable
\item \code{var_best}: best estimate for the variable
\item \code{var_conf}: confidence for the estimate
}

The column with names is unique, the other columns are a block and can be
repeated for each variable.

Moreover, the name of the columns is not important, \code{elic_add_data()} will
overwrite it according to the following convention:

\emph{varname}_\emph{suffix}

with \emph{suffix} being one of \emph{min}, \emph{max}, \emph{best}, or \emph{conf}. The information
to build the column names is taken from the metadata available in the
\code{elicit} object.
}

\section{Data cleaning}{


When data are added to the \code{elicit} object, first names are standardised by
converting capital letters to lower case, and by removing any whitespaces and
punctuation. Then, data are anonymised by converting names to short sha1
hashes. In this way, sensible information collected during the elicitation
process never reaches the \code{elicit} object.

If the data are imported from \emph{Google Sheets}, \code{elic_add_data()} performs
additional data cleaning operations. First, if present, removes the column
with the timestamp. Second, checks for consistency of the decimal separator,
i.e. commas \emph{,} are replaced with periods \emph{.}. Finally, all columns but the
first one (which contains the names) are forced to numeric.
