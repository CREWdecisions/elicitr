\usage{
elic_start(
  var_names,
  var_types,

  experts,
  ...,

  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{var_names}{character vector with the name of the estimated variables.}

\item{var_types}{character string with short codes indicating the variable
type. If only one \code{var_type} is provided, its value is recycled for all
variables. See Variable Types for more.}

\item{elic_types}{character string with short codes indicating the
elicitation type. If only one \code{elic_type} is provided, its value is recycled
for all variables. See Elicitation Types for more.}

\item{experts}{numeric indicating the number of experts participating at the
elicitation process.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments, included only for future extensions of the
function.}

\item{title}{character, used to bind a name to the object.}

\item{verbose}{logical, if \code{TRUE} prints informative messages.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{elicit} binding metadata related to the
elicitation process. These metadata are used by other functions to validate
the correctness of the provided data.

\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}

\code{elic_start()} initialises an \code{elicit}
object which stores important metadata for the data collected during the
elicitation process.

\section{Variable Types}{


Variable types must be provided as a single string containing short codes,
e.g. "pPN".

Valid short codes are:
\itemize{
\item \code{Z}: \emph{integers}, when the estimate must be an integer number in the
interval (-Inf, Inf).
\item \code{N}: \emph{positive integers}, when the estimate must be an integer number in
the interval (0, Inf).
\item \code{z}: \emph{negative integers}, when the estimate must be an integer number in
the interval (-Inf, 0].
\item \code{R}: \emph{reals}, when the estimate must be a real number in the interval
(-Inf, Inf).
\item \code{s}: \emph{positive reals}, when the estimate must be a real number in the
interval (0, Inf).
\item \code{r}: \emph{negative reals}, when the estimate must be a real number in the
interval (-Inf, ].
\item \code{p}: \emph{probability}, when the estimate must be a real number in the interval
(0, 1).
}
}

\section{Elicitation types}{


Elicitation types must be provided as a single string containing short codes,
e.g. "134".

Valid short codes are:
\itemize{
\item \code{1}: \emph{one point elicitation}, when only the best estimate is provided.
\item \code{3}: \emph{three points elicitation}, when the minimum, maximum, and best
estimates are provided.
\item \code{4}: \emph{four points elicitation}, when the minimum, maximum, best, and
confidence estimates are provided.

\examples{
# Create the elict object for an elicitation process that estimates 3
# variables, the first for a one point estimation of a positive integer, the
# second for three points estimation of a negative real, and the last for a
# four point estimation of a probability
x <- elic_start(var_names = c("var1", "var2", "var3"),
                var_types = "Nrp",
                elic_types = "134",
                experts = 4)
x

# A title can be added to bind a name to the object:
x <- elic_start(var_names = c("var1", "var2", "var3"),
                var_types = "Nrp",
                elic_types = "134",
                experts = 4,
                title = "My elicitation")
x
# Notice that if var_types and elic_types are provided as single character,
# their value is recycled and applied to all variables. In the following
# example all three variables will be considered for a four point estimation
# to estimate a probability:
x <- elic_start(var_names = c("var1", "var2", "var3"),
                var_types = "p",
                elic_types = "4",
                experts = 4)
