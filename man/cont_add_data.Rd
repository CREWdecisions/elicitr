\item{data_source}{either a \code{\link[base:data.frame]{data.frame}} or
\code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble}}, a string with the path to a \emph{csv} or \emph{xlsx} file,
or anything accepted by the \link[googlesheets4:range_read]{read_sheet} function.}

\item{round}{integer indicating if the data belongs to the first or second
elicitation round.}

function.}

\item{sep}{character used as field separator, used only when \code{data_source} is
a path to a \emph{csv} file.}

\item{sheet}{integer or character to select the sheet. The sheet can be
referenced by its position with a number or by its name with a string. Used
only when \code{data_source} is a path to a \emph{xlsx} file or when data are imported
from \emph{Google Sheets}.}

\item{overwrite}{logical, whether to overwrite existing data already added to
the \link{elic_cont} object.}

\item{verbose}{logical, if \code{TRUE} it prints informative messages.}

\item{anonymise}{logical, if \code{TRUE} expert names are anonymised before adding
the data to the \link{elic_cont} object.}

The provided object of class \link{elic_cont} updated with the data.

\code{cont_add_data()} adds data to an \link{elic_cont} object from different sources.
}
\section{Data format}{


Data are expected to have the name of the expert always as first column. The
only exception is for data coming from \emph{Google Sheet} which can have an
additional column with a timestamp. This column is automatically removed
before the data are added to the \link{elic_cont} object (see "Data cleaning").
After the name there should be one or more blocks which follow the
specifications below:

\emph{One point elicitation}:
\itemize{
\item \code{var_best}: best estimate for the variable
}

\emph{Three points elicitation}:
\itemize{
\item \code{var_min}: minimum estimate for the variable
\item \code{var_max}: maximum estimate for the variable
\item \code{var_best}: best estimate for the variable
}

\emph{Four points elicitation}:
\itemize{
\item \code{var_min}: minimum estimate for the variable
\item \code{var_max}: maximum estimate for the variable
\item \code{var_best}: best estimate for the variable
\item \code{var_conf}: confidence for the estimate
}

The column with names is unique, the other columns are a block and can be
repeated for each variable.

Moreover, the name of the columns is not important, \code{cont_add_data()} will
overwrite it according to the following convention:

\emph{variable_name}_\emph{suffix}

with \emph{suffix} being one of \emph{min}, \emph{max}, \emph{best}, or \emph{conf}. The information
to build the column names is taken from the metadata available in the
\link{elic_cont} object.

\code{var_conf}, given as percentage, can be any number in the range (50, 100].
Any value smaller or equal to 50 would imply that the accuracy of the
estimates is only due to chance).
}

\section{Data cleaning}{


When data are added to the \link{elic_cont} object, first names are standardised
by converting capital letters to lower case, and by removing any whitespaces
and punctuation. Then, data are anonymised by converting names to short sha1
hashes. In this way, sensible information collected during the elicitation
process never reaches the \link{elic_cont} object. For three and four points
elicitation processes, the order of the values is checked for each expert. If
it is not \emph{min-max-best}, the values are swapped accordingly and a
informative warn is raised.

If the data are imported from \emph{Google Sheets}, \code{cont_add_data()} performs
additional data cleaning operations. This is relevant when data are collected
with Google Forms because, for example, there could be multiple submission by
the same expert or a different decimal separator could be used. When data are
collected with Google Form, a column with the date and time is recorded.
First, the function checks for multiple submissions and if present, only the
last submission is retained. Second, the function removes the column with the
timestamp. Then it checks for consistency of the decimal separator, i.e.
commas \emph{,} are replaced with periods \emph{.}. Finally, all columns but the first
one (which contains the names) are forced to numeric.
