\usage{
cat_start(
  levels,
  sites,
  experts,
  mechanisms,
  ...,
  title = "Elicitation",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{levels}{character vector with the names of the levels of impact. See
Levels for more.}

\item{sites}{character vector with the names of all sites investigated. See
Sites for more.}

\item{experts}{numeric, indicating the maximum number of experts
participating in the elicitation process for one mechanism. See Experts for
more.}

\item{mechanisms}{character vector with the names of the mechanisms of impact
investigated.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments, included only for future extensions of the
function.}

\item{title}{character, used to bind a name to the object.}

\item{verbose}{logical, if \code{TRUE} it prints informative messages.}
}
\value{
An object of class \link{elic_cat} binding metadata related to the
elicitation process. These metadata are used by other functions to validate
the correctness of the provided data.
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental}{\figure{lifecycle-experimental.svg}{options: alt='[Experimental]'}}}{\strong{[Experimental]}}

\code{cat_start()} initialises an \link{elic_cat} object which stores important
metadata for the data collected during the elicitation process of categorical
data.
}
\section{Levels}{


Levels are inherited between mechanisms. A minimum of two levels are needed.
If only one level is investigated, please refer to the functions for the
elicitation of continuous data (e.g. \link{elic_cont_start}).
}

\section{Sites}{


The site parameter is a character vector containing the names of all the
sites investigated in the elicitation. However, not all sites have to be
investigated in every mechanism of impact.
}

\section{Experts}{


The expert parameter is a number indicating the maximum number of experts
taking part in the elicitation of one of the investigated mechanisms of
impact. The number and IDs of experts can differ between the mechanisms.

# Create the elic_cat object for an elicitation process over 2 mechanisms of
# impact, 3 sites, 3 levels per sites, and a maximum number of experts per
# mechanism of 8.
