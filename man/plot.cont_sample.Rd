function.}

\item{expert_names}{numeric or character, the labels for the experts.}

\item{theme}{\code{\link[ggplot2:theme]{theme}} function to be used in the plot.}

\item{beeswarm_cex}{numeric, the space between points in the beeswarm plot.}

\item{beeswarm_corral}{character string, the wrapping corral for the beeswarm
plot. Anything accepted by the \link[ggbeeswarm:geom_beeswarm]{geom_beeswarm}
function.

#' @section scale_conf:

If the variable plotted is the result of a four points elicitation where
expert confidence is provided, the minimum and maximum values provided by
each expert are rescaled using their provided confidence categories. Users
can choose how they want to rescale minimum and maximum values by providing a
value for the \code{scale_conf} argument. If no argument is provided, a default
value of 100 is used for scale_conf.

The scaled minimum and maximum values are obtained with:

\eqn{minimum = best\ guess - (best\ guess - minimum)\frac{scale\_conf}
{confidence}}

\eqn{maximum = best\ guess + (maximum - best\ guess) \frac{scale\_conf}
{confidence}}}
}
\value{
Invisibly a \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot}} object.

\code{plot()} aggregates and plots continuous samples as violin or density plot.

\details{
If a \code{theme} is provided, the \code{family} argument is ignored.
