### Description

elicitr is an R package used to standardise, visualise and aggregate data from expert elicitation.\
The package is in active development and will implement functions based on two formal elicitation methods:

* Elicitation of continuous variables\
  Adapted from Hemming, V. et al. (2018). A practical guide to structured expert elicitation using the IDEA protocol. Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 9(1), 169–180. https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12857
* Elicitation of categorical data\

### Installation

You can install the development version of elicitr from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("CREWdecisions/elicitr")
```

### Getting started

```{r}
library(elicitr)
```

All the functions in the elicitr package start with the prefix `elic_`. After that, two prefixes are available: `elic_cont` and `elic_cat`. This design choice is intended to enhance functions discovery.\
`elic_cont` functions are used for the elicitation of continuous variables and `elic_cat` functions for the elicitation of categorical variables.

### Elicitation of continuous variables

#### Simulated datasets

Two simulated datasets are included in elicitr. These datasets are intended to demonstrate the functionality of the package and do not represent an actual elicitation process (names are also randomly generated).

```{r}
round_1
```
###
```{r}
round_2
```

#### How elicitr works

For the analysis of continuous variables, the core of the elicitr package is an object of class `elic_cont`. Just as you create a form to collect estimates in an elicitation process, you need to create the `elic_cont` object to store metadata information. This allows to check whether all experts have given their answers in the expected way.\
Any analysis starts by creating the `elic_cont` object with the function `elic_cont_start()`.To build this `elic_cont` object, Four parameters must be specified: 

* `var` the number of variables (i.e. the number of topics in your elicitation)
* `var_types` the type of variables for each of these variables (many options are available, ranging from real numbers to probabilities)
* `elic_types` the type of elicitation for each of these variables (three options are available: one, three, and four points elicitations)
* `experts` the number of experts that replied to the elicitation

```{r}
my_elicitation <- elic_cont_start(var = c("var1", "var2", "var3"),
                                  var_types = "ZNp",
                                  elic_types = "134",
                                  experts = 6,
                                  title = "Elicitation example")
```
###
```{r, echo = FALSE}
my_elicitation
```

Once the metadata has been added to the `elic_cont`object, the data of the first round of elicitation can be added with the function `elic_cont_add_data()`;

```{r}
my_elicitation <- elic_cont_add_data(my_elicitation,
                                    data_source = round_1,
                                    round = 1)
```

The information message confirms that the data for the first round has been added to the metadata from a `data.frame`. Besides `data frames`, elicitr also allows users to add data from `.csv` or `.xlsx` files, and from Google Sheets.

If you conducted a second round of elicitation, it can be added to the `elic_cont` object after the first round has been added:

```{r}
my_elicitation <- elic_cont_add_data(my_elicitation,
                                    data_source = round_2,
                                    round = 2)
```

To keep the anonymity of experts, their names are converted to short sha1 hashes and saved in the `id` column. These are then used to match the expert’s answers in the two rounds.

The function `elic_cont_get_data()` retrieves data from an `elicit` object. It is possible to get the whole dataset of a given round, or extract only the data for a given variable, variable type, or elicitation type.

```{r}
elic_cont_get_data(my_elicitation,
                   round = 1,
                   var = "all")
```

Finally, data can be plotted using the function `elic_cont_plot()`. This function plots data belonging to a given round and for a given variable.

```{r cont_plot}
elic_cont_plot(my_elicitation,
               round = 2,
               group = TRUE,
               var = "var3",
               xlab = "Variable 3",
               ylab = "Experts")
```

The variable plotted in this case is the result of a four points elicitation, where minimum and maximum estimates, best guess, and expert confidence is provided. In the plot, the best guess is represented with a dot, and the range between minimum and maximum estimates is represented with a line. Expert estimates are represented in purple, while the group's mean is represented in orange.

The message printed here informs users that the minimum and maximum value given by experts have been rescaled using their provided confidence level. Users can choose how they want to rescale these values by providing a `scale_conf` argument.

The scaled minimum and maximum values are obtained with:
$\text{minimum} = \text{best guess} - \frac{\text{scale_conf }(\text{best guess} - \text{minimum})}{\text{confidence}}$
$\text{maximum} = \text{best guess} + \frac{\text{scale_conf }(\text{maximum} - \text{best guess})}{\text{confidence}}$

`scale_conf` can also be used to avoid rescaling the minimum and maximum values. To do this, the confidence of experts must be provided for `scale_conf`. If `group` is set to `TRUE`, a value will have to be provided for the scaling of the group (here we set this value to 100%).

```{r}
round2_var3 <- elic_cont_get_data(my_elicitation,
                                  round = 2,
                                  var = "var3")

expert_confidence <- round2_var3$var3_conf
```
```{r cont_plot_noscale}
elic_cont_plot(my_elicitation,
               round = 2,
               group = TRUE,
               var = "var3",
               xlab = "Variable 3",
               ylab = "Experts",
               scale_conf = c(expert_confidence, 100))
```
